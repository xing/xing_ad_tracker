# App Install Ads in the XING AdManager
The XING AdManager provides the possibility to create ad campaigns advertise apps for Android or iOS within the XING network. As most of the time the success of app ad campaigns is measured in app installs we provide the possibility to attribute app installs to the campaign that triggered them. To achieve this, we match the users that clicked on your ad to users who open your app for the first time. Therefore your app needs to send some tracking information to XING. We provide a tracking snippet that can easily be integrated into your app so the required tracking is fired once the app is started for the first time. 

For more information see the individual sections for 

**[iOS](./iOS/README.md)** or 

**[Android](./Android/README.md).** 

They contain developer related "how-tos" to integrate the code into your app.
